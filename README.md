This repository contains solutions to coding problems I solve during my last three months of military service. I focus on core topics like arrays, hashing, stacks, and queues, while exploring techniques like two pointers, sliding window, and prefix sums. I also study algorithms like sorting and searching, emphasizing understanding how and why.
